#### **{{ act.title }}**

##### From years of shared musical experience in various musical contexts, an ensemble developed with **Thomas Milacher** on bass, **Martin Kleibl** on drums and **Anna Maurer** on piano that combines the tradition of the piano trio with a fusion from jazz, Latin, rock and influences of the classical music tradition leads logically into its own musical cosmos. The complex rhythmic and harmonic structures that Anna Maurer knows how to use in the deeply unique style of her compositions for the benefit of the music and her audience play a crucial role.
