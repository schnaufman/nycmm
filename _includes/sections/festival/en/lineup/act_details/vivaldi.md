##### The Swing Ã  la Django Band's latest exciting musical experiment - with the two gold records - is an adaptation of the most popular work by the famous Italian composer and violinist Antonio Vivaldi. Everyone knows the violin concertos of the Four Seasons, but the work has never been heard in this form. The entire piece has been reworked to take listeners on an inspiring journey through different musical styles. Familiar melodies are transformed into exciting swing, jazz, Latin and folk sounds and rhythms, interspersed with Italian, French, Hungarian, Spanish and American melodies and virtuosic improvisations. The aim of the experiment is to bring Baroque music closer to today's people and make the genius of the past more accessible!
