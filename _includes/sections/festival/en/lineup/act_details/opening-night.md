##### The cross-disciplinary Opening Night is dedicated to the creative combination of music and dance with contemporary dancers from the **IDA-Institute of Dance Arts** at the Bruckner University in Linz and the jazz ensemble **Gravity**.

The extent to which art and culture can support this will be discussed with guests from business, politics and culture from the region.
