##### On August 6, 2025, the 14th NYC Music Marathon will kick off in Mattighofen with a cross-disciplinary opening night titled "Garden Diversity & Art: Connect, Newly Discovered!" The evening will combine inspiring live music with current questions about natural gardening, garden strategies, and biodiversity.
##### How can gardens become resilient oases for humans and animals – even in times of heat waves and heavy rain? What are the reasons for the disappearance of bees, butterflies, and birds – and how can we help them thrive? These and other questions will be the focus of an entertaining panel discussion with exciting guests from the fields of gardening, the environment, and science.
##### The evening's music will be provided by the multifaceted jazz ensemble **Culturessence** together with the US singer **Chanda Rule**, who will focus on the relationship between humans and nature with their program "River." Their soundscapes create a poetic bridge between musical depth and an appreciative connection with nature.
##### Look forward to a diverse, entertaining, and inspiring evening that brings art and nature into a lively dialogue—in the spirit of the NYC Music Marathon, which will once again bring socially relevant topics to life in a creative way in 2025.
