##### The cross-disciplinary Opening Night is dedicated to the creative combination of music and dance with contemporary dancers from the **IDA-Institute of Dance Arts** at the Bruckner University in Linz and the jazz ensemble **Gravity**. Another highlight of this evening is an encounter in conversation with people who are committed to integration in the social environment. The extent to which art and culture can support this will be discussed with, among others, the cultural manager and dancer **Mirjam Sadjak** as well as with guests from business, politics and culture from the region.
##### Moderation: Antonia-Alexa Georgiew
##### Gravity: Thomas Kugi (ts), Andreas Haidecker (guit), Navid Djawadi (b), Gernot Bernroider (drums)
