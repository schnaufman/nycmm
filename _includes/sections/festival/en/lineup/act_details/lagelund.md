##### “Swing à la Django” brings together 7 Hungarian music virtuosos who, in this concert, combine the classical music of violinist Antonio Vivaldi and his masterpiece “The 4 Seasons” with swing, jazz, folk and Latin American sounds. The award-winning ensemble plays with the passion of the Gipsy jazz legend Django Reinhardt and takes its audience on a varied and entertaining musical journey, where they are amazed at the virtuosity of the musicians and the versatile sounds and rhythms and are delighted by the power and beauty which allows music to be absorbed. The ensemble was awarded two gold records and was on stage with, among others, Sting, Zubin Mehta, Andrea Bocelli and Roby Lakatos.
