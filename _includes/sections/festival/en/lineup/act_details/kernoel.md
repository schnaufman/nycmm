##### Similar to the NYCMM concept of pampering with tried-and-true and seducing with new, the **Kernölsalsa Club** performs its usually sold-out concerts. Founded in Styria, the ensemble, consisting of top-class musicians from the Austrian music scene, combines Caribbean rhythms and salsa with Austro-pop classics. For those who want to shake a leg this evening, there's the opportunity to join a salsa dance crash course during the concert: **a bailar!**
##### **Gregor Bischops** (voc & hand perc), **Eva Moreno** (vocals & hand perc), **Werner Radzik** (keys & arr.), **Andi Fürstner** (guitar & tres), **Thomas Stabler** (dr), **Ewald Gaulhofer** (congas), **Thomas Radzik** (timbales), **Stefan Padinger** (b), **Christoph Pfeiffer** (trp), **Karl Rossmann** (trp), **Gernot Strebl** (ts), **Reinhard Summerer** (trb & arr.)
