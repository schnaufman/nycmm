##### What's better than a Sunday in the park?
##### The NYC Music Marathon is once again inviting you to play, dance, sing and do crafts in the Voglpark Mattighofen with numerous (musical) stations. At the drum circle with **Helmut Bimashofer**, young and old can get to know groovy rhythms together. The highlight of the day is a fantastic participatory concert with **Brennholz Rocks** from 1 p.m., where people not only listen, but also clap, stomp and sing along.
