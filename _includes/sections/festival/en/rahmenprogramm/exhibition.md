##### The [Atelier "Nessling"](https://www.atelier-nessling.at/){:rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} presents images in the form of Sabine Nessling, whose creative process is not only slightly different from the manual, but was also often exhausting. The interplay between intuitive action and analytical control as well as the opposite poles of calm and dynamic, excitement and serenity, fullness and reduction inform the artistic process of this artist from St. Pantaleon.
