##### We have been pleased to see over the last few years that even very young musicians are appreciating our workshops more and more. Since we know that a whole day of workshops can be quite strenuous, this year we are offering the **Funky Cats Kids Workshop**, a half-day workshop especially for musically talented children!
##### At the Funky Cats Kids Workshop, participants learn to get more out of their instrument or voice with international lecturers. What you have learned can be applied straight away in group combo lessons and presented on the big stage at the end of the workshop.
