#### Workshop 2 - Just Sing! A Capella Ensemble
##### If you like to sing in a group, the A Capella Ensemble is perfect for you. Explore your voice like an instrument and sing polyphonically in harmony with others. In addition to a capella arrangements of trendy songs (pop, jazz & soul), we also sing our own arrangements and songs in this workshop. A performance at the final concert is the final highlight of the JUST SING! Workshops.
