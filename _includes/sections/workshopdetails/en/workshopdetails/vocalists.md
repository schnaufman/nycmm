## **Workshops for Vocalists**
#### As a vocal participant, you can choose one of 3 workshops when registering (ticket shop) and deal with a cappella, stage presence or songwriting as desired.

For early risers (despite nightly jam sessions) there is a meditation or yoga session every morning followed by vocal warm-up exercises for all vocal participants.
